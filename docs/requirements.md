# Browser Compatibility

Rather than come up with minimum versions for every browser I will use this rule: If [caniuse](http://caniuse.com) reports that globally at least 60% and in the US at least 75% of the users can use the feature, then it is OK to use.

The exception is webassembly itself which is currently only around 50% for both global and US usage.
